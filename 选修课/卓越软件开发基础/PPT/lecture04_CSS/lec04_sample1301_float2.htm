		So we browsed the shops, buying here and there, but browsing at least every other store. The street vendors were less abundant, but <em>much</em> more persistent, which was sort of funny. Kat was fun to watch, too, as she haggled with various sellers. I don't think we paid more than two-thirds the original asking price on anything!
